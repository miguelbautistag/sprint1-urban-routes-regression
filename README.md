# Urban Routes – Regression Testing Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on executing regression testing for the Urban Routes transportation application. 
The goal was to validate core routing, pricing, and transport mode functionality after changes to the system.

## 🧪 Scope of Testing
- Route calculation (From / To)
- Transport modes (Taxi, Walking, Bike, Scooter, Car Sharing)
- Travel duration and price calculation
- UI behavior across modes

## 📋 Test Artifacts
- Regression test cases
- Test execution results
- Detailed bug reports with severity classification

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Manual Testing
- Regression Testing
- Bug Reporting
- Google Sheets (Test cases & bug tracking)
- Chrome Browser

## 🐞 Key Outcomes
- Executed full regression suite
- Identified multiple defects across pricing and routing logic
- Reported bugs with clear reproduction steps and severity levels

## 📎 Notes
All test cases and bug reports were created as part of a structured QA process following industry best practices.

## 🌍 Documentation Language Note
The original test cases, bug reports, and supporting documentation for this project were created in Spanish as part of the bootcamp delivery requirements.

All project structure, testing approach, and outcomes are documented in English in this repository. 
I am comfortable explaining and discussing all test artifacts in English during interviews or technical discussions.
